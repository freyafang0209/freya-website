# HigherEd Signals

HigherEd Signals is an independent research-style content project focused on enrollment forecasting, international student demand signals, and institutional decision-making in volatile policy environments.

The site explores how universities interpret early behavioral indicators，such as deposits, engagement patterns, and policy uncertainty — before final outcomes (e.g., visa decisions) are known.

## About This Project
This project is currently in a testing phase, observing how niche, long-form analytical content is discovered, indexed, and interpreted by search engines and AI systems.

Instead of publishing high-frequency SEO content, HigherEd Signals focuses on insight-led, framework-based commentary designed for a more research-oriented audience in higher education strategy and enrollment planning.

## Tech Stack
- Notion (Content source)
- Next.js (Notion-powered blog structure)
- Vercel (Hosting & deployment)
- Google Search Console (Indexing monitoring)

## Notes
This is an independent analytical project and does not represent institutional advice. Content is intended for research discussion on higher education trends, enrollment behavior, and forecasting approaches in volatile global contexts.
